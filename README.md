## Setup and Compilation (on Windows)

To compile this template on Windows, it is recommended to install [MiKTex](https://miktex.org/).

Then simply do 

```
pdflatex resume.tex
```

The compilation process might notify necessary installation of additional packages.
Just click `install` and let it perform automatically.
If the process stops somewhere on the command line, just press `Enter` to continue.
The result will be `resume.pdf`, which is a PDF version of your resume.
